# radiomarche linked data 
This repo is used for the Linked Data demonstrator based on the original RadioMarche application. This Linked Data demonstrator is described in [1]. To serve this data, simply load it into any RDF triple store that can provide you with a SPARQL endpoint. An excellent platform is cliopatria (http://cliopatria.swi-prolog.org). An example use of this data is through a voice application as described in [1]. The code for this application can be found at https://github.com/biktorrr/speakle .

Note that this Linked Data version of the data does not work with the original RadioMarche application, which is available at https://github.com/nanabaahgyan/RadioMarche . For the original RadioMarche application, please contact Nana Baah Gyan (nanabaahgyan@gmail.com) or Stephane Boyera (stephane@sbc4d.com)
